# React + Vite

This project uses **React with Vite** to provide a fast and minimal development setup with **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** and basic **ESLint** rules.

## Features

* React powered by Vite
* Fast Refresh support
* Minimal and clean setup

## Plugins

* `@vitejs/plugin-react` – uses Babel (or oxc) for Fast Refresh
* `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` – uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## Notes

* React Compiler is not enabled due to performance impact
* For production apps, TypeScript with type-aware ESLint rules is recommended
